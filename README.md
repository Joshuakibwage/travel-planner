  #travel planner app

  The idea of building a travel planner is appealing to me because travel planning can be overwhelming and I want to simplify the process for users. Travel planner can help people discover destinations, accommodations, activities and dining options all in one place. I surely enjoy making user-friendly web applications and this project will allow me to apply the skills that Iâ€™ve learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, React.js and TailwaindCss while integrating real time travel data .

 #technologies used
 -React and tailwind
 -API : TripAdvisor api
 -State Management: React Hooks
 -Web Storage: Local storage for saving itineraries

 Happy Traveling!
